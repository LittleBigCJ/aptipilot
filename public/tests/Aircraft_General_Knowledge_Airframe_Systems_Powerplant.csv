AGK1-001,Structures,Easy,A monocoque fuselage primarily relies on:,Skin to carry structural loads,Frames only without skin,Truss members only,No load-bearing elements,Monocoque uses stressed skin for strength.
AGK1-002,Powerplant,Medium,An intercooler in a turbocharged engine is used to:,Cool compressed induction air before it enters the engine,Cool the engine oil,Heat cabin air,Reduce fuel temperature,Cooling increases air density and reduces detonation risk.
AGK1-003,Fuel,Easy,A fuel tank vent prevents:,Vacuum formation and ensures proper fuel flow,Carburetor icing,Battery discharge,Hydraulic lock,Venting allows atmospheric pressure to replace used fuel volume.
AGK1-004,Electrical,Medium,The main function of an aircraft alternator is to:,Generate electrical power at various RPMs,Store electrical energy,Convert DC to AC,Regulate bus voltage by itself,Alternator with regulator maintains bus voltage and charges the battery.
AGK1-005,Hydraulics,Easy,Hydraulic systems use relief valves to:,Limit maximum system pressure,Filter particulates,Cool the fluid,Separate water from fluid,Relief valves protect components from over-pressure.
AGK1-006,Pneumatics,Medium,Bleed air from a turbine engine is often used for:,Cabin pressurization and anti-ice,Propeller pitch control only,Landing gear extension only,Fuel pump operation,Bleed air supplies pressurization and anti-icing.
AGK1-007,Landing Gear,Hard,An oleo-pneumatic landing gear strut absorbs shocks using:,Compressed gas and hydraulic fluid,Springs only,Magnets,Electric actuators alone,Gas compresses and fluid orifices damp motion.
AGK1-008,Structures,Medium,The purpose of stringers in semi-monocoque construction is to:,Provide longitudinal stiffness,Carry primary bending loads alone,Serve as fuel conduits only,Reduce electrical interference,Stringers stiffen the skin and distribute loads.
AGK1-009,Powerplant,Easy,The primary purpose of a mixture control in a piston engine is to:,Regulate the fuel/air ratio,Control ignition timing,Regulate oil pressure,Adjust propeller pitch,Mixture sets the correct fuel/air ratio for combustion.
AGK1-010,Fuel,Medium,Water in aviation fuel is hazardous because it:,Can freeze and block fuel lines,Improves detonation margin,Reduces fuel weight,Acts as a lubricant,Ice crystals can obstruct flow and cause engine failure.
