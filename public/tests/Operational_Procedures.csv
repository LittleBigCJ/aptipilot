OPS-001,General,Easy,Before entering a known icing area a pilot should ensure:,Anti-ice/de-ice systems are operational,Autopilot is off,Landing lights are on,Flaps are fully extended,Proper ice protection is essential before entering icing.
OPS-002,General,Medium,The sterile cockpit rule requires:,No non-essential conversation below 10,000 ft,Full radio silence at all times,Only the captain may speak during cruise,Use of autopilot in all phases,It limits distractions during critical phases of flight.
OPS-003,Emergency,Easy,A rejected takeoff decision is normally made:,At or before V1,After rotation,During climb,After gear retraction,V1 is the maximum speed for a safe stop.
OPS-004,General,Medium,The purpose of a minimum equipment list (MEL) is to:,Specify which equipment may be inoperative for dispatch,Detail all maintenance tasks,Provide ATC frequency allocations,Set fuel reserves,MEL allows limited operations with certain inoperative equipment.
OPS-005,Emergency,Easy,The initial action after an engine failure after takeoff is:,Maintain control and best glide speed,Feather the propeller immediately,Retract flaps fully,Change transponder code first,Maintaining control and airspeed is critical.
OPS-006,General,Hard,The term ETOPS refers to:,Extended-range Twin-engine Operations,Engine Torque Operating Pressure,Electronic Takeoff Power System,Emergency Terrain Operations,ETOPS allows twins to operate beyond standard diversion limits.
OPS-007,Emergency,Medium,A rapid decompression requires the crew to:,Don oxygen masks and initiate emergency descent,Switch off cabin lights,Descend slowly without oxygen,Shut down engines,Oxygen and descent are immediate priorities.
OPS-008,General,Easy,A stabilized approach means:,Configured, on-speed, and on path by 1000 ft AGL,Idle thrust and steep descent,Landing gear up until short final,Approach flown visually only,Stable speed and configuration reduce go-around risk.
OPS-009,General,Medium,Minimum fuel advisory is declared when:,Fuel remaining is sufficient for destination but cannot accept delay,Reserves are below legal minimum,An emergency is required immediately,Fuel leak is suspected,Minimum fuel indicates no extra for holding but not yet emergency.
OPS-010,General,Easy,Before crossing an active runway a pilot must:,Receive specific clearance from ATC,Only monitor tower frequency,Flash landing lights,Set transponder to standby,ATC clearance ensures runway separation.
